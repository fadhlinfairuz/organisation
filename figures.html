  <div class="text">
    <h2>Tok Guru Nik Aziz</h2>
    <p>Mohammad Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, widely known as Tok Guru Nik Aziz (1931–2015), was a revered Islamic scholar and politician from Kelantan. Born and raised in Kelantan, he dedicated his life to Islamic education and spiritual guidance, becoming a symbol of piety and integrity for many Malaysians. His deep knowledge of the Quran and Hadith shaped his approach to leadership and public service.
</p>
<p>
Tok Guru Nik Aziz served as the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of Kelantan from 1990 to 2013, making significant contributions to the state’s governance. Under his leadership, Kelantan focused on implementing Islamic values in administration, promoting education, and improving the welfare of its citizens. His policies emphasized honesty, social justice, and community development, earning him widespread respect across Malaysia.
</p>
<p>
Beyond politics, Tok Guru was admired for his humility, simplicity, and devotion to the people. He remained accessible to ordinary citizens, often engaging in dialogue and providing guidance. His legacy continues to influence religious scholars, politicians, and the people of Kelantan, who remember him as a leader who combined spiritual insight with compassionate governance.</p>

<section id="tok-janggut" class="figure-section">
  <img src="tokjanggut.jpeg" alt="Tok Janggut">
  <div class="text">
    <h2>Tok Janggut</h2>
    <p>Haji Mat Hassan bin Munas, better known as Tok Janggut, was born in 1853 and became a Malay warrior who opposed British intervention in Kelantan. Following the Bangkok Agreement of 1909, the British introduced administrative changes that affected traditional leaders, including head taxes and levies on fruit trees, coconuts, and betel plants. These measures angered the locals and threatened the authority and privileges of Kelantan’s traditional rulers, setting the stage for conflict.
</p>
<p>
Chaos erupted in Jeram, Pasir Puteh, on 29 April 1915, as the British-appointed Colonial Officer, Mr. Latiff, began enforcing tax collection strictly. Tok Janggut, together with Haji Said, Che Sahak, and Penghulu Adam, decided to resist the British government. Supported by a large number of locals, they confronted the colonial forces. During a skirmish at Kampung Tok Akib, Sergeant Che Wan was killed, prompting the British to issue an order to arrest Tok Janggut, which escalated tensions further.
</p>
<p>
Military reinforcements from Singapore and the Federated Malay States arrived, and by 6 May 1915, Tok Janggut moved toward Pasir Puteh. The British launched an attack on 25 May 1915 at Kampung Merbuk and Kampung Pupuh, where Tok Janggut was killed. His body was taken to Kota Bharu, hanged for several days, and finally buried in Pasir Pekan at Padang Bank (Padang Merdeka). Today, Tok Janggut is remembered as a symbol of resistance and courage against colonial rule in Kelantan.</p>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Sultan Muhammad IV</h2>
    <p>Sultan Muhammad IV ibni al-Marhum Sultan Muhammad III or Tuan Long Senik was the son of Long Kundur (Sultan Muhammad III). He was born on 23 May 1858 by his mother, Tengku Ampuan Kelantan Tengku Sofia binti Raja Long Putih Pattani. He was appointed Tengku Sri Indra Mahkota in 1890 and subsequently to the position of Raja Muda Kelantan on 25 July 1898 by his uncle's father, Sultan Mansur. He ascended the throne in 1899 succeeding his uncle's father with the title Raja and Yang Di-Pertuan of Kelantan but only began to use the title Sultan, in 1911, after signing an agreement with the British to recognise him as the Sultan of Kelantan on the condition that he accept British Advisors. He ruled until 1920. During his reign, Kelantan achieved rapid progress in the spiritual and physical fields, moving towards modernization, with a more democratic, neat and orderly government system with the opening of offices and schools that became a solid foundation for Kelantan to thrive in the following eras.</p>

After returning to Kelantan, Tok Kenali dedicated his life to teaching and spreading Islamic knowledge. He played an important role in reforming Islamic education by encouraging systematic learning and critical thinking among students. As an educator, he was known for his humility, discipline, and strong spiritual character, which made him highly respected by both scholars and the general public.
